            Satisfaction levels with Waste Services improved marginally over the last period with 76.3% of adults being satisfied with local refuse collection. 
     <br>
            This is slightly above the national average of 75.3%.  It is an increase of 1% since the last reporting period.  It is, however, lower than the majority of Councils.  
     
            Spend on refuse collection is the highest in Scotland, by a significant margin, as has been the case for over 5 years.  
     <br><br>
            Satisfaction levels do not correlate with spend levels and work is underway to review service delivery models that will drive changes to the waste service that will in turn reduce costs. 
     <br>
            Household waste recycling dipped during the Covid period but has shown an increase over the last year rising from 48% to 51%.  We are in the top 10 authorities in Scotland for recycling levels.
