                    There has been a reduction in expenditure in parks and open spaces over the last reported period. In 2018-19, over
                    £26k was spent per 1000 people on parks and open spaces. In 2020-21, this reduced to under £20.5k per 1000 people.

                    The key information from the DBEIS data is the emissions reduction trend over time. Compared with 2019, per capita
                    emissions for the full data-set across the Stirling area decreased in the Industrial & Commercial sector (by 8.3%),
                    in the Domestic sector (by 4.2%) and in the Transport sector (by 25.6%). This combined to give a total area-wide
                    emissions reduction of 20.7% during 2020. This was an exceptional year as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold and
                    economic activity closed down for months at a time. It is anticipated that emissions will increase for 2021 as
                    economic activity began to pick up again following the worst impacts of the pandemic.

                    At 4.9 tonnes, per capita emissions for the full Stirling data-set were 6.5% higher than the Scottish local
                    authority area average of 4.6 tonnes. This is not a valid comparison, however, as the two baseline measures were not
                    the same in 2005 (having a 17.2% difference between them). A more meaningful comparison is the % reduction in per
                    capita emissions since 2005. For Stirling there has been a 47.7% reduction in this measure since 2005, while the
                    Scottish average is 48.1% for the same period.

                    These comparisons highlight the difficulties in making direct comparisons between authorities as each has its own
                    circumstances, especially with regard to industrial and commercial activity. Some areas have heavy industry which
                    could have very large emissions, while many have little heavy industry at all. Similarly, some authorities will have
                    more through traffic than others or will have more dispersed populations, so transport emissions may be higher.
                    Domestic emissions tend to vary less from place to place, but there are still many influencing factors that may need
                    to be taken into account, such as fuel types used locally, type and condition of housing (including insulation),
                    average temperature, average household size, type of household, plus income and preferences of the occupiers. Land
                    area and use differences introduce a host of other considerations, which is why these emissions figures are not
                    intended to be used to make comparisons between local authority areas.
