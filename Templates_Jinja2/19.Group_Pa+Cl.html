    Our environmental services are crucial in ensuring attractive and welcoming places. 
    They protect community areas and allow for biodiversity in our open spaces. 
    They deal with our waste and promote and encourage recycling.      
    They lead on active transport strategies that support a just transition to net zero, encouraging more active travel modes in our road network, and promote collaboration to develop community pride in local areas.   
    <br><br>
    Clean, safe and well-maintained communities foster a sense of pride among residents that lead to stronger and more resilient communities and they make our communities  more attractive.  
    Environmental indicators encompass waste and recycling services, street cleanliness services, and roads services.    
    They provide financial outcomes and satisfaction levels from households.

        The key information from the DBEIS data is the emissions reduction trend over time. Compared with 2020, per capita emissions for the full dataset across the Stirling area increased in the Industrial & Commercial sector (by 11.7%), in the Domestic sector (by 4.8%) and in the Transport sector (by 13.6%). This combined to give a total area-wide emissions increase of 10.6% during 2021. This was an exceptional year as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold and economic activity closed down for months at a time. It was anticipated that emissions would increase for 2021, after the exceptional conditions in 2020, as economic activity began to pick up again following the worst impacts of the pandemic.  At 4.6 tonnes, per capita emissions for the full Stirling data-set were 9.8% lower than the Scottish local authority area average of 5.1 tonnes.
        <br><br>
        This is not a valid comparison, however, as the two baseline measures were more similar not the same in 2005 (having a 2.2% difference between them). A more meaningful comparison is the % reduction in per capita emissions since 2005. For Stirling there has been a 47.7% reduction in this measure since 2005, while the Scottish average is 43.3% for the same period.
        <br><br>
        These comparisons highlight the difficulties in making direct comparisons between authorities as each has its own circumstances, especially with regard to industrial and commercial activity. Some areas have heavy industry which could have very large emissions, while many have little heavy industry at all. Similarly, some authorities will have more through traffic than others or will have more dispersed populations, so transport emissions may be higher. Domestic emissions tend to vary less from place to place, but there are still many influencing factors that may need to be taken into account, such as fuel types used locally, type and condition of housing (including insulation), average temperature, average household size, type of household, plus income and preferences of the occupiers. Land area and use differences introduce a host of other considerations, which is why these emissions figures are not intended to be used to make comparisons between local authority areas.
