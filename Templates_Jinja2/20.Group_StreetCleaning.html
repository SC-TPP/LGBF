    <p>Only 65.9% of residents are satisfied with local street cleanliness.

    This is comparative generally with other family group authorities and is a significantly improved picture from 55.5% in 2019-20 and 59.5% in 2020-21.  
    
    It is higher than the Scottish average of 60%.  
</p><p>
    A Litter Strategy will be developed over the next year, that will provide strategic direction for the Service and promote community collaboration in street cleanliness work.  
    
    Spend on street cleaning is quite high when compared nationally, and highest in our family group.  
    
    Spend has remained relatively static, with a dip in 2020-21 during the Covid period.
</p>
