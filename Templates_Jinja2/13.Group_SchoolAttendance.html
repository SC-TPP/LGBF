    {% set Comment = "  Attendance and exclusion data is collected and reported nationally, every two years. Most recent published 2020-21 data shows Stirling school attendance to be 93.4% compared to a national average of 92.0% and Stirling to be ranked second highest within its family group of comparator authorities.  The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on school attendance for some children and young people, and published data confirms an overall declining trend of school attendance across Scotland.  Local data however suggests that in Stirling, the rate of decline is less than Scotland's average. 
                        Stirling has very low numbers of exclusion and our most recent published exclusion rate of 7.0 cases per 1,000 pupils is again lower than the national rate of 11.9 cases per 1,000 pupils.  Stirling is ranked second lowest within its group of comparator authorities for exclusion rates.  
                        There has been an enhanced focus in Stirling on school attendance for looked after young people, which has led to an increase in their attendance.  Cases of exclusion are also very low within Stirling for looked after young people.  Exclusion rates for this group have been decreasing over the last few years and Stirling is ranked second lowest authority within its family group.  
                        We will continue to work with schools to support the ongoing review and monitoring of attendance and there will be an enhanced focus on inclusion and developing and embedding inclusive practice next session.  Discussions have also started across the Forth Valley and West Lothian Regional Improvement Collaborative (RIC) with an enhanced focus on improving school attendance across all four local authorities within the RIC and this work will continue into the new academic session.  Stirling's Virtual Head Team will continue to focus on improving attendance and educational outcomes for children and young people with experience of care. 
                        Partially influenced by the LGBF data, the Service has worked closely with schools to reduce exclusions, particularly for children and young people who face disadvantage.  We are working within the Regional Improvement Collaborative, identified schools will improve attendance. "%}
