                <p>
                    Our priority focus continues to work with schools and external organisations to close the attainment gap and widen
                    the curriculum offer within our Stirling secondary schools. A key focus of this work is identifying action to
                    promote equity and using attainment data to evaluate existing interventions and identify areas of further
                    improvement. Within this it is recognised that developing a wider curriculum offer and increasing flexible
                    progression pathways are important areas of development in order to provide the most appropriate and positive
                    outcomes for our young people.

                    Due to Covid-19, that change in certification methods in 20/21 and the cancellation of examinations in 2019/20,
                    caution should be exercised when comparing data with previous years. Any change between the attainment levels of the
                    2020/21 cohort and those of previous years should therefore not be seen as an indication that performance has
                    improved, or worsened without further analysis.
