                        There has been a sharp reduction in expenditure in road maintenance over the last 2 years. In 2018-19, over
                        £13.5k/kilometre was invested and in 20-21 under £10.5k/kilometre. This is capital and revenue expenditure.

                        The impact of Covid-19 lockdown on roads services resulted in a reduction in planned work and a reliance on reactive
                        repairs of defects to keep the road network safe. This has inevitably led to an increased backlog of repair work and
                        a reduction in overall network condition and satisfaction. The condition of A, B and C roads declined over the
                        period, and there was a marginal improvement in the reported condition of unclassified roads.

                        Changes in weather patterns have exacerbated drainage issues and extreme rainfall events have had significant
                        impacts on road infrastructure and the level of funding required to address road drainage issues.

                        The SCOTS (Society of Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland) Backlog and Steady State Model 2019 document
                        details that the headline backlog figure is £49.8m (in 2019 when the model was run). This headline backlog figure
                        indicates funding required to remove all defects in red and amber categories (defective in some way). The document
                        also details a “steady state” figure of £6.07m for Stirling. This figure has been calculated as the funding required
                        to prevent further decline in the road network's condition. The Capital budget for years 2019/20 was £5,307,123. In
                        20/21 it was £3,250,000. It should be noted that these figures will have increased somewhat, given the volatile
                        material price market as well as inflationary increases seen since Brexit and Covid pandemic, potentially by up to
                        30%.

                        The Service, under new management in 22/23, is working to review asset management principles per the national Road
                        Asset Management Project as supported by SCOTS. This review will ensure that capital budgets are invested
                        appropriately, to improve the condition of the road network, by intervening at appropriate points in the assets'
                        lifespans to deliver Best Value.
