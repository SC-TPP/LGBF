    Investment in roads over the last period increased from £10.7k/km in 20-21 to £11.6k/km in 21-22.
    <br>
    However, the cost of construction materials due to Brexit and Covid fluctuations and of inflation resulted in less being done for more. 
    <br>
    Investment levels have reduced overall since 2018-19 when £13.6k/km was invested in roads. 
    <br>
    Road condition information for 21-22 indicates improvement over all classifications. 
    <br><br>
    Condition is poorer than Scottish averages by some margin across all classifications and if further deterioration in condition is to be arrested, additional investment in roads will be required. 
    <br>
    The majority of Councils in Scotland have road networks that are in better condition than Stirling Councils. Moving to a risk based approach and a review of the road asset management plan will lead to better management and maintenance of the network, with improved planning and investment.
