                <p>
                    The External Auditor's report on the 2020/21 financial year outlines that the Council's financial management is
                    effective with strong budgeting, financial monitoring and reporting processes that are aligned to its corporate
                    priorities. The Council and its wider group financial position is sustainable into the foreseeable future, although
                    Covid-19 continues to add additional pressure and uncertainty.
                    <br>
                    The Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Council's finances during 2020/21. Additional budget pressures
                    totalled £8.9 million for the year and these were addressed through a combination of using Council reserves and
                    additional Scottish Government funding.
                    Stirling Council reported a general fund surplus of £16.9 million for 2020/21, which was largely due to the receipt
                    of additional funding to meet Covid pressures in future years. This has resulted in a large increase in the
                    Council's reserves with £17 million earmarked for pandemic recovery.
                    <br>
                    The Council has developed a Covid-19 Recovery Plan, which was approved in June 2021. It sets out 14 priorities, and
                    accompanying actions, which are aligned to the strategic goals within the 10-year Council strategy. The Council
                    recognises the non-recurring nature of such reserves and has taken steps to ensure they are used effectively and in
                    line with Council strategy and strategic objectives.
                    <br>
                    The Council's 10-year strategy includes a transformation plan to address the longer-term financial challenge.
                    Aligned to this, Stirling Council projects a cumulative £28 million budget deficit over the next 5 years and is in
                    the process of reviewing its income and expenditure streams in advance of the 2022/23 budget.
