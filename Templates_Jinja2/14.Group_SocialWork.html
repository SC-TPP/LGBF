    {% set Comment = "<p>In 2021/22 there has been a continuing and broadly positive trend for the Children & Families LGBF measures. Most of these are bettering the national average and this is also the case when comparing against the Family Group Median for similar local authorities. The gross costs for the provision of residential care services and care within community settings have both risen slightly in 2021/22, however both remain significantly below the national average which has itself seen an increase reflecting the increased costs that are being experienced nationally. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The number of residential placements that we have continues to be low and our young people who are in these placements tend to have higher levels of need which is reflected in care packages that are more expensive. Our Resource Allocation Group regularly reviews all placements where young people are placed away from home to ensure that they receive the right support tailored to their needs supporting them to return to their home or community as quickly as possible. This has also meant that the balance of care for looked after children in community settings has also improved continuing this positive trend, comparing favourably against the national average and the decreasing percentage for our Family Group Median. The proportion of looked after children who have had more than one placement move in the last year has also reduced continuing the positive downwards trend remaining below the national average and Family Group Median. This is especially positive as some of the placement moves were planned where young people were returning from residential placements and into a community setting. The number of Child Protection Re-registrations that have taken place within 18 months has also improved significantly from 15.2% down to 7.8% bringing us below the national average and much closer to our Family Group Median. This increases our confidence that decision making when considering de-registration is appropriate and effective. </p>"%}
