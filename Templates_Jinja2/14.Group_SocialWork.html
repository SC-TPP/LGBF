                    The LGBF measures for Children & Families have been broadly positive for 2020/21 with the majority of measures
                    bettering the national average and at the top end of our family group of local authorities.
                    This has also been the case over time with the majority of measures showing a broadly positive trend over the last 5
                    years. The work that has been undertaken and services delivered have helped to minimise the impact of COVID-19 and
                    associated restrictions on our young people and their families.
