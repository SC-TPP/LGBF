                <p>
                    1140 hours of early learning and childcare has been delivered in Stirling in all nurseries, and with funded
                    childminders, since August 2020. This was one year ahead of the statutory duty. In addition to this, parents/carers
                    can purchase more hours where available and can purchase places for babies and toddlers until they become entitled
                    to free childcare.

                    Over the last 2 years, we have focussed on developing a Play and Learning Framework which places value on the
                    importance of relationships, communication, interactions, family and of diverse communities working together to
                    support the children. It provides a shared framework, which enables all Funded Providers; local authority, partner
                    nurseries and partner childminders, to collaborate with each other, children and families in order to promote the
                    rights of the child. This ensures a consistent and holistic approach in scaffolding and progressing children's
                    learning and development, through play.
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    We are working now to embed the Framework, further develop approaches to self-evaluation and redesign family
                    learning to ensure it is relevant and accessible to all children and families.
