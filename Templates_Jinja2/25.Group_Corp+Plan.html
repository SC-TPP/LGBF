                <p>Infrastructure Delivery continue to apply the guiding asset management principles as outlined within Stirling Council's Property Asset Management Strategy, driving efficiencies through the use of space and ensuring spaces are fit for purpose for future service delivery. <p>
                <p>Our five year revolving programme of property conditioning  investigation and annual review, is illustrating a steady position of delivering a good quality operational estate with 91.07% achieving an A and B rating  in 21/22.</p>
                <p>In 21/22 the percentage of internal floor area of operational buildings in satisfactory condition achieved 96.79%, the increase is credited to the large scale refurbishment projects of the 1140 Early Years programme. 22/23 will see the 1140 programme come to a conclusion with larger projects including extensions and new builds impacting on our future footprint.</p>
                <p>Recognising that both revenue and capital projects are pressured over the coming years, officers will continue to prioritise investment to maximise the impact on our operational estate.</p>

                <p>Local developments include applications for changes to individual houses and smaller developments for new housing as well as applications covering areas of development such as minerals, business & industry, waste management, electricity generation, freshwater fish farming, marine finfish farming, marine shellfish farming, telecommunications, Approval of Matters Specified in Conditions (AMSCs) and other developments.</p>
        <br>    <p>From mid-March 2020 planning application processing was initially impacted by the move to home working with insufficient technology to efficiently process planning applications, restrictions on site visits and staffing and resourcing issues due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in a reduction in the number of applications processed and decided during the first two quarters.  There was a large increase in householder applications and a reduction in the number of local applications. This is also reflective of the impacts of Covid-19, with many homeowners carrying out improvement works and/or to create space for home working arrangements.</p>
        <br>    <p>Drilling down further into the statistics shows that performance in the latter part of the reporting period had stabilised and improved. For example, the average timescales for processing householder applications in February and March 2021 were 6.8 and 6.1 weeks respectively, significantly faster than the Scottish average and well within statutory timescales. This was reflective of an increased resource within the team and lower number of local applications. The cost of planning and building standards services is standardised per planning application and building warrant. This measure includes costs of both planning and building standards services. Total Planning Costs is calculated using the following components of the Local Financial Return (LFR 07: Building, Planning and Development), divided by the Number of decided planning applications. This data is collected by Scottish Government from Local and Planning Authorities as part of the Planning Performance Framework. In 20/21 Stirling was included in just under a third of Councils reporting reduced costs. Whilst the number of applications determined in 2020/21 is only slightly above those in 2019/20, as mentioned previously the make-up of applications shifted in 20/21.</p>
