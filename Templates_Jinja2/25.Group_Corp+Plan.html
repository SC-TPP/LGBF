                                <p>In the fiscal year 2021-22, Stirling's ECON 02 indicator, which measures the cost per planning application, showed significant improvement. The cost decreased from &pound;6,152 to &pound;4,965, marking a notable 19.2% reduction. This progress boosted the city's standing in its family group, ranking 4th out of 8, and within the broader Scottish context, ranking 20th out of 32.
                                </p>
                                <p>In contrast, ECON 03, which tracks the average time per commercial planning application, experienced a decline in performance over the same period. The average time increased by 21.6%, rising from 10.02 to 12.19 weeks. Consequently, Stirling's position within its family group dropped to 7th out of 8, and its ranking within Scotland decreased to 19th out of 32.
                                </p>
                                <p>In summary, Stirling Council's performance demonstrated positive advancement in terms of planning application cost (ECON 02). However, it's worth noting that the reduction in cost might be directly linked to the decline observed in the time taken for commercial planning applications (ECON 03).</p>
