                Work is ongoing to ensure that commissioned care provision is in line Clackmannanshire & Stirling HSCPâ€™s strategic
                priorities to provide care closer to home and to support people living with dementia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Discharges continue to be treated as priority 1 under eligibility criteria. Performance in this key area has been
                challenging during the Covid pandemic and related crisis within care at home and care home services.
