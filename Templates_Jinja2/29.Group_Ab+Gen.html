        <p>The circumstances around the pandemic affecting the workplace including lockdown and social distancing rules led to a significant reduction in absence across all local authorities, as is reflected in absence data for 2020/21.  However, there was for a number of years prior,  a trend of increasing absence.  Subsequent to 2020/21,  the main reasons for absence remain psychological and musculoskeletal.  However gastrointestinal reasons continue to be a significant proportion of working days lost.  During 2021/22 the reduction in absence due to infectious diseases has been replaced by those due to coughs, colds and flu.  
        </p>
        <p>The Employee Wellbeing Programme continues to provide proactive practical, online, and face-to-face support for employees experiencing a variety of health issues and enables access to comprehensive well-being information and signposting to additional support.  This is tailored and targeted in line with service needs and reasons for absence.    In addition, we provide a comprehensive Occupational Health Service to our employees including health surveillance, physiotherapy and employee counselling services.  </p>

    <p>Our organisation continues to make significant strides towards gender equality in the workplace. The gender pay gap remains impressively low, standing at just 0.1% in favour of women. This achievement not only places us at the top within our family group but also first for all of Scotland.
    </p><p>
    Furthermore, our commitment to promoting women's representation at the highest levels is evident. Despite a slight decrease of 0.01%, we maintain a strong presence of 61.6% of women among the highest-paid 5% of employees.
