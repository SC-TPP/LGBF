    {% set Comment = "  Over the last six years, Stirling Council early learning and childcare settings have been ranked top in the Local Government Benchmarking Framework family group in terms of the quality indicators graded by the national scrutiny body, the Care Inspectorate.   In session 2021-2022, 93.2% of our settings were graded good or better in all four inspection quality themes, down from 97.6% the previous year.  This drop is due to some private partner provision falling below the national standard grading of ‘good’ or better.  Stirling remains above the national average of 89.4% and ranked second in its family group, in 2021-22.  We are currently working with 3 private partners to support improvement and are refining our approaches to self-evaluation.
                        The Public Health Early Child Development Report for 2021-2022 has shown an increase in the percentage of children with at least one developmental concern during their 27-30 month review.  Nationally the figure increased from 14.9% to 17.9% and in Stirling it has increased from 13.9% to 16.8%. The group of children in this report is likely to have their early childhood experiences significantly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic period.  Stirling is ranked top of its family group in terms of uptake of 27-30 month reviews and ranked sixth in terms of concerns recorded.  Staff are implementing a range of strategies and working with partners to support development in these areas.  Additionally, a Leadership Academy for senior staff in nurseries has been launched and a training programme is in place for middle leaders.  The Play and Learning Framework is embedded in practice, part of which is supporting more effective tracking and monitoring of children’s learning and there is continued work on the gathering and use of data.  The LGBF data concerning developmental concerns played a contributing role in the successful partnership with speech and language therapy colleagues to develop communicative learning environments
                        The cost per pre-school registration in Stirling remains top of the family group and second top nationally.  Efficiencies have been approved at Council and are being implemented.
                        Partially influenced by the LGBF data, we are looking at a more efficient approach to the delivery of early learning and childcare.  We are also working with Education Scotland to improve our approaches to self-evaluation for continuous improvement. "%}
