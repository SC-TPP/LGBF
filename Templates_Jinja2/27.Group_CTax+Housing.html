        <p>Gross rent arrears have shown a positive decline from 11.3% to 9.8% and Housing's Income Maximisation officers continue to provide high quality advice and assistance to support Stirling Council tenants in maximising income and improving their financial wellbeing.

        <p>Void rates and rent loss continue to be affected by market conditions of inflation, supply chain issues, shortages and delays in sourcing some materials/stock combined with continued difficulties in organising work with utility companies and recruitment and retention issues.  Despite a shift in our national ranking from 7th to 11th, and a corresponding change in our family ranking from 3rd to 5th, we are committed to channelling resources towards enhancing our performance in this aspect and achieving better outcomes.</p>

    <p>Income from Council Taxpayers makes up around 20% of the Council’s total income, and for financial year 2021/22 this represents £53.2 million. As households continue to move through the Covid-19 pandemic recovery phase, there has been a favourable impact on the Council Tax collection rate, with Stirling’s collection rate being 97.7% for the year, representing a 0.6% increase from the prior year level (97.1%). On a Scotland-wide basis, Stirling's ranking has moved from top to second place for in-year Council Tax collections. 
    </p>
<p>Council Tax collection continues to represent a significant strength area, with the Council continuing to display high performance in this area. The Service continues to actively seek improvement opportunities through more efficient working practices and deployment of staffing resources required to support Council Tax collection. This work has resulted in a favourable impact on the cost per dwelling of collecting Council Tax, with Stirling's cost falling to £4.88 from the prior year level of £7.15, with the Council moving to 9th lowest in Scotland.
