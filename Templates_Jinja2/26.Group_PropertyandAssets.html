    Stirling Council recorded an improvement in some elements of performance in 2021/22 despite the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic, labour and material shortages and additional requirements on tenant and resident safety.  Shqs compliance dropped from 90.8% to 80.9% a drop of 10%.  The overall drop within the local authority sector was higher at around 14%, affected by new requirements of interlinked smoke and heat alarms and electrical safety requirements.
<br><br>
    Repairs performance has also continued to be affected by labour and material shortages and spiralling costs but the service continues to perform above average within the local authority sector.  The service has also seen improvements in relation to the energy efficiency performance within properties. 
    Our investment in energy efficiency measures continues in order to ensure that we maximise our compliance and prepare for long-term solutions that deliver net zero and support the eradication of fuel poverty by continuing to invest in energy efficiency measures to help reduce running costs, and in zero emissions heating systems where appropriate.
