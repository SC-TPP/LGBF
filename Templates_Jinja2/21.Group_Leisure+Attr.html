                The library cost per visit is up slightly at £3.05 rather than £2.32 in 2019-10, but the higher figure is in line
                with previous years.
                Visitor numbers for all library services dropped significantly in 20-21 with enforced closures due to COVID.

                In Stirling visits fell from 1,007,096 in 2019-20 to 686,561. This reflects the fact that from March until July 2020
                our service had to be delivered online-only.
                During this period, we invested in online resources and promoted e-books, e-audio books, newspapers and magazines
                available online. This resulted in a huge increase in online use.

                From 17th March 2020 when Lockdown began to 31st March 21, Stirling Libraries issued a total of 35233 e-books. As
                soon as we were able to do so, we offered a Select and Collect service where books could be requested and collected
                from library entrances and from mobile library vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
                This ran from July to December 2020, with some libraries opening briefly for browsing and computer access in
                November and December before all physical services were forced to close again in the New Year. They remained closed
                until April 2021. During the six-month period where physical books could be lent, a total of 51,300 physical books
                were borrowed.

                Stirling Libraries have adapted to changing conditions and made the service available as widely and safely as
                restrictions allowed at every stage. All libraries opened for browsing and computer use in August 2021.
            
                We are gradually re-introducing groups and activities, starting with the larger libraries.
