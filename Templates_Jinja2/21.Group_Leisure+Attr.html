        <p> In common with other services throughout Scotland, Stirling experienced a marked drop in physical use during Covid with extended closures at all service points. We reinstated access at the earliest opportunity in line with public health guidance.  By mid-August 2021 all libraries in Stirling had re-opened for browsing and computer use and reverted to normal hours of operation. Regular groups and activities resumed from autumn 2021 starting with the larger libraries.  Given these factors the steady increase in physical visits recorded over the year is encouraging and this trend has continued since.  However, the figure for virtual visits dropped significantly in 2021-22, resulting in a rise in our cost per issue.  This increased from £3.05 to £5.28 for the period, moving our family group ranking from 2nd to 5th.  The service attributes the rise to an anomaly with Facebook measurement. The counting method changed during the year, showing a steep drop in use not reflected in any other platform or online resource.  Numbers involved were sufficient to indicate a fall in virtual engagement overall which does not reflect patterns of use at the time.

        <p>The satisfaction level among adults visiting the museum exhibited stability at 71.8%, thereby cementing its standing a second within its family grouping. Particularly striking is the substantial and favourable shift in the 'cost of Museums per visit,' which saw a dramatic plunge from £57.41 to an incredibly affordable £3.72 as soon as public access was reinstated. Intriguingly, this period also witnessed a strategic integration of digital mediums that supplemented the physical visits. A comprehensive online engagement strategy coupled with extensive outreach endeavours facilitated an enriched experience for enthusiasts. These innovative approaches connected a broader audience and ushered in a new era of accessibility and inclusivity.
        </p>
        <p>The approval rating for leisure facilities experienced a continued ascent, rising from 76.6% to 78.3%. Regrettably, this upward trend was accompanied by a decline in the family ranking, slipping from 2nd to 1st place. The expenditure per visit at sports facilities saw a substantial reduction, plummeting from £218.96 to an economical £14.56. It's worth noting, however, that despite this impressive drop, it still remains at the 8th position among the 8 attractions in our family grouping and at the 30th position out of 32 attractions in Scotland.
