                    1140 hours of early learning and childcare has been delivered in Stirling in all nurseries, and with funded childminders, since August 2020. This was one year ahead of the statutory duty. In addition to this, parents/carers can purchase more hours where available and can purchase places for babies and toddlers until they become entitled to free childcare. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the last 2 years, we have focussed on developing a Play and Learning Framework which places value on the importance of relationships, communication, interactions, family and of diverse communities working together to support the children. It provides a shared framework, which enables all Funded Providers; local authority, partner nurseries and partner childminders, to collaborate with each other, children and families in order to promote the rights of the child. This ensures a consistent and holistic approach in scaffolding and progressing childrenâ€™s learning and development, through play.
                </p>
                <p>
                  
We are working now to embed the Framework, further develop approaches to self-evaluation and redesign family learning to ensure it is relevant and accessible to all children and families.
