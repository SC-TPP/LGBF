                                Stirling Council recorded an improvement in performance in 2020/21 despite the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic
                                and remains above the Scottish local authority average of 86.35% with 93.12% of Stirling Council social rented
                                properties recorded as meeting compliance with the Energy Efficiency Standard for Social Housing (EESSH1) standard
                                at 31st March 2021.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our investment in energy efficiency measures continues in order to ensure that we maximise our compliance with the
                                new Energy Efficiency Standard for Social Housing 2 (EESSH2) that requires all Scottish Registered Social Landlords
                                to strive to achieve an energy efficiency rating of 'B' or above for all social rented stock by 2032. Investment in
                                energy efficiency measures to date has resulted in 57.5% (3,311 homes) of our housing stock already meeting the new
                                2032 target.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Achieving a rating of 'B' or above removes the energy efficiency of a property as one of the four drivers of fuel
                                poverty.
