    <p>
        Expenditure on waste and recycling has risen significantly over the last year. The cost of Stirling Councilâ€™s Waste
        Service is the highest in Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Covid-19 Pandemic had a significant impact on the Councils Waste Services during 2020-2021. Operational
        pressures resulted in significant spend on contingency resources and the general behaviour of residents saw
        household waste arisings becoming higher than pre-pandemic levels which in turn resulted in higher than normal costs
        for waste collections and disposals. This is primarily attributed to people working from home and the restrictions
        on travel generating more waste.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Short Life Working Group has been formed to review the way that the waste service is delivered in Stirling and
        this will address the cost of service provision
