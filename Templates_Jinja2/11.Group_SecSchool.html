    {% set Comment = "  <p>The most recent published Local Government Benchmarking Framework data shows a largely positive pattern of improvement in attainment and outcomes for young people within Stirling secondary schools.  
                        
                        The number of young people securing a positive destination upon leaving school in Stirling has increased from last year and remains the highest level on record.   The improvement in destination figures can be attributed to continued close monitoring and tracking of young people at risk of not securing a positive destination post school. The Service continue to identify appropriate interventions and opportunities which will support young people to sustain their chosen destination. 
                        
                        The overall percentage of young people leaving school in Stirling with five or more awards at both Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) level 5 or better and level 6 or better has shown continued improvement over the last ten years.  Tariff point graphs show a similar positive picture for the majority of pupils and for almost all attainment measures Stirling is top of its family group.  
                        
                        Attainment of Stirling's young people living in areas with higher levels of deprivation is showing some improvement in some measures, however this is not as widespread as that for all pupils.  There has been a gradual increase in the percentage of those young people living in Quintile 1 gaining five or more awards at SCQF level 5 or better on leaving school but not the same improvement for those same pupils achievement of five or more awards at SCQF level 6 or better or total tariff points, at point of leaving.  Generally Stirling is ranked 4th or 5th in its family group for attainment measures for pupils from higher levels of deprivation.
                        </p>
                        <p>Improving outcomes for our most vulnerable learners, including those most impacted by poverty, remains a key priority in Stirling and focus continues to be on working with schools and external organisations to close the attainment gap and widen the curriculum offer within all our secondary schools.  We have improved collaboration between our secondary schools in recent years and will have a continued focus on widening the curriculum offer to ensure there are appropriate, flexible progression pathways for all learners, with an improved balance between vocational and academic qualifications.  
                        
                        Please note, the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted school leaver destinations directly in 2019/20 but there is likely to have been an ongoing impact in the years following.  Similarly, Covid-19 resulted in different approaches to certification of school leaver attainment over a number of years.  For this reason a dashed line break has been placed in the attainment graphs for the years affected.  This indicates that the attainment of school leavers in 2019/20, 2020/21 and 2021/22 has been determined differently to that for 2018/19 school leavers and before and caution should be exercised when comparing attainment levels across years.
                       
                        Partially influenced by the LGBF data, the Service has developed a governance structure and an Improvement Plan focused on targeted supports to improve equity.  We are continuing to develop curriculum pathways to improve opportunities for targeted young people.  We are also working with Education Scotland to improve our approaches to self-evaluation for continuous improvement, with a particular focus on attainment for children and young people who face disadvantage.</p> "%}
