    <p>
        Since 2018/19 to 2020/21, the aggregated Environmental Health, Trading Standards, Money Advice and Citizens’ Advice costs per 1000 population has reduced from £25.30K to £22.68K.  We have been consistently ranked 8th in the family group. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Given the diverse nature of both Environmental Health and Trading Standards combined with our unique provision of shared services it is not clear how accurate the comparisons are across Councils but the overall trend points to a reduction in costs. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Knowledge of the Service brings the conclusion that this reduction is attributable to a reduction in staffing.  Ensuring adequate staffing resource remains a challenge due to the reducing number of Officer qualifying as Environmental Health and Trading Standards Officers. It will be critical to monitor the position of both Trading Standards and Environmental Health Services going forward to fully understand the impact of this.
