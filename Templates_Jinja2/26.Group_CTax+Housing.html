                    Income from Council Taxpayers makes up around 20% of the Council’s total income, and for financial year 2020/21 this
                    represents £52.7 million. Unfortunately, the COVID pandemic significantly impacted on Council Tax collection rates
                    during the year, with Stirling’s collection rate seeing a 0.7% fall from prior year levels, representing a reduction
                    in income collected of £0.7 million.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, despite the adverse impact of COVID on collection levels, Stirling maintained top ranking in Scotland for %
                    of Council Tax collected. Council Tax collection continues to represent a significant strength area, with the
                    Council continuing to display high performance in this area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Service continues to actively seek improvement opportunities through more efficient working practices and
                    deployment of staffing resources required to support Council Tax collection.
