    <p>Stirling's performance in this section is notably positive, standing out favourably when compared to other Councils both at the famikly group and national levels. This achievement reflects the collective efforts and commitment across the entire Council.
    </p>
    <p>While we celebrate our overall success, we recognize that there is still targeted work to be done in certain areas outlined in the locality action plan. These efforts aim to address the socio-economic disparities between these communities and the Council-wide position, ensuring that progress is inclusive and beneficial for all.
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, it is encouraging to see that two of the indicators have secured the top position within our family group. However, we have observed a slight decrease from the first position, where 13.2% of people were earning less than the living wage, to the third position at 11.9%. This minor setback serves as a reminder of the importance of ongoing dedication to promoting fair wages and economic well-being for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, we remain committed to building on our strengths, addressing challenges, and creating a more equitable and prosperous community for all of Stirling's residents. Together, we will continue to strive for positive outcomes and sustainable progress.</p>
