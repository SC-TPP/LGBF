        "<p>The HSCP invested in additional resources to support people in our communities who have been identified as requiring community reablement; personal care at home or appropriate long term nursing care. 
        
        Work continues through the Carers Planning Group to further engage with carers in communities. 
    </p>
    <p>
        During 21/22 the HSCP planned to recruit a Carers lead role to progress the work to further support unpaid carers to continue their caring role.Â  
        
        The HSCP continues to focus on the delivery of care and support which will enable individuals, their families and carers more choice and control over their care and support.</p>"
