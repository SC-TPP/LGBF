    <p>
        Data confirms that Stirling is ranked 8 out of 32 local authorities for school attendance rates which is positive
        however, similar to the national trend, we are recording a declining pattern. Attendance continues to remain a high
        priority for education, taking account of the declining pattern and the link between attendance and attainment.
    </p>
    <p>
        A range of work has been undertaken to explore the reasons for higher absences, which include pupil mental
        wellbeing, parental issues and curriculum offers not meeting the needs for some learners.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many schools are using the Pupil Equity Fund to recruit additional health and wellbeing officers who can work with
        families to help identify and alleviate the range of possible barriers to good attendance. Schools and nurseries are
        using attendance data more regularly to identify absences at an earlier stage to reduce the risks of persistent low
        attendance. This recent work may explain why the decline in attendance in Stirling is less significant than the
        national pattern or that of our family group; 2018/19 to 202/21 shows a Scottish decline of 1% and a family group of
        0.5% compared to 0.3% in Stirling.

        Future activity includes a review and update of Stirling’s guidance on ‘Promoting and Managing School Attendance’
        for education establishments. There will also be a focus on S4 attendance at a Regional Improvement Collaborative
        (RIC) level informed by data and, adopting an equity lens approach to considering further improvements in attendance
        for pupils from areas of high deprivation. Supporting care experienced children and young people to attend and
        engage in education continues to be a key priority for the Virtual Head Team.
