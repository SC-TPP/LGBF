        <p>To enhance the comprehensiveness of our reporting, we have introduced new indicators that shed light on critical aspects of our community's well-being. A notable area of concern is the Scottish Welfare Fund (SWF) Expenditure, which has experienced a significant surge in demand over recent years, and this trend continues to rise. The SWF encompasses Crisis Grants designed to assist individuals with low incomes who find themselves in crisis due to emergencies, as well as Community Care Grants (CCG) aimed at promoting independent living. These grants primarily address the exceptional pressures faced by families. Additionally, the growing expenditure on Discretionary Housing Payments (DHP) provides further evidence of the financial challenges our local communities are grappling with. DHPs serve as a vital tool in preventing homelessness and supporting households struggling to maintain their tenancies.
        </p>
        <p>In response to these pressing concerns, we have incorporated new indicators into our reporting framework. These indicators include CORP 9, which assesses the proportion of SWF Crisis Grants decisions made within one day, and CORP 10, focusing on the proportion of SWF Community Care Grants decisions finalized within fifteen days. Alongside these indicators, CORP 11 offers insight into the proportion of the SWF budget that has been utilized, and CORP 12 delves into the proportion of Discretionary Housing Payments funding that has been allocated. By introducing these indicators, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges our community faces and the effectiveness of the support measures in place.
