"                           <p>In June 2022, Stirling Achievement of Curriculum for Excellence (ACEL) attainment reflected the national picture, where the percentage of primary pupils achieving the expected Curriculum for Excellence level increased across all organisers and stages, as compared to 2021.  In comparison to national and family group performance, Stirling schools perform positively overall and attainment was returning to or exceeding pre pandemic levels due to schools focused efforts on recovery, resilience and reconnection. Stirling is ranked top within its Local Government Benchmark Framework family group for overall ACEL attainment.</p>               
                            <p>The attainment gap between in Stirling decreased in 2022 in both literacy and numeracy to the lowest since ACEL recording began in 2017 (experimental reporting until 2018-19).  Whilst the Stirling gap remains greater than the national gap, recent figures demonstrate a significant reduction from the previous 2020-21 gap.  The Stirling 2022 gap was for the first time, lower than the family group average in both literacy and numeracy, with Stirling 2nd lowest authority in the group for literacy gap and 3rd lowest authority for numeracy gap.</p>
                            <p>Attainment of Q1 learners and closing the poverty related attainment gap remains a focus.  Effective tracking and monitoring of the progress of this group of learners indicates that targeted interventions are having a positive impact on outcomes.  The Stirling Data Champions programme has been further developed, to include Learning Community Data Champions.  This approach is also supporting schools to make best use of data for improvement with a clear focus on learners affected by poverty.</p>
                            <p>Partially influenced by the LGBF data, the Service has developed a governance structure and an Improvement Plan focused on targeted supports to improve equity.  We are also working with Education Scotland to improve our approaches to self-evaluation for continuous improvement, with a particular focus on attainment for children and young people who face disadvantage.</p>     "%}
