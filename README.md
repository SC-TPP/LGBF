# Scottish Local Government Benchmark Framework Indicator Data Made Computer Accessible.

!!! Currently WIP !!!

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook used to transform the LGBF raw data file on the Improvement Services Public Website into a more computer friendly format meant for data/performance analysts to use with Business Intelligence tools such as PowerBI. It also contains the resulting data in csv format. 

>> Dataset CSV Field Descriptions will go here along with usable links to the data.

Example files are provided that demonstrate how this data can be used within PowerBI to automate report creationn (both digital interactive reporting and A4 paginated reporting). In addition to this there is also an excel file with a predefined datamodel using links to the files hosted here. There will also be a notebook developed shortly that will provide an example as to how a report can be created using Python.

Any users who would like to contribute and improve this dataset should contact corporateperformance@stirling.gov.uk. My Python knowledge is limited so I am sure there are many improvements that can be made to the notebooks.

If any users have additional fields they would like to be added again please contact corporateperformance@stirling.gov.uk and we will attempt to provide these (if resource allows).

All data provided here is publically available on the Improvement Service's website. Any users should verify the validity of this data independently. There is no guarantee that the data transformations applied in the Notebook are correct (although I believe they are and have done some limited verification of this).

Data will be refreshed each time a new file is publically available on the Improvement Services Website.
