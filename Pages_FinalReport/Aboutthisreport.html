<H2>What is LGBF</H2>
<P>
    The LGBF is a high-level benchmarking tool designed to support senior management teams and elected members to ask questions about key council services.

    It reflects a commitment by SOLACE (Scotland) and COSLA to develop better measurement and comparable data as a catalyst for improving services, targeting resources to areas of greatest impact and enhancing public accountability.
    The framework provides high-level ‘can openers’ which are designed to focus questions on why variations in cost and performance are occurring between similar councils. They do not supply the answers. That happens as councils engage with each other to ‘drill down’ and explore why these variations are happening.
    
    The LGBF helps councils compare their performance against a suite of efficiency, output and outcome indicators that cover all areas of local government activity. The framework now has 8 years of data. Publication of the LGBF forms part of each council’s statutory requirements for public performance reporting, replacing the previous SPI regime.
    
    The LGBF voluntarily applies the high standards for statistical rigour set out in the three pillars of the UK Statistics Authority Code of Practice – trustworthiness, quality, and value.

<H2>Family groups</H2>
<p>To help communities and councils draw meaningful comparisons from the LGBF data, authorities are arranged in `family groups’, enabling comparisons to be made between councils that are similar in terms of the type of population that they serve (e.g. relative deprivation and affluence) and the type of area in which they serve them (e.g. urban, semi-rural, rural). The point of comparing like with like is that this is more likely to lead to useful learning and improvement.</p>
